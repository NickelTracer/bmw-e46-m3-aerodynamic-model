Surface model of BMW M3 E46 with test prototype of rear wing based on NACA 6409 Aerofoil

Model designed for simulation purposes in Ansys FLUENT. Work in progress!

Rear wing - made with use of NACA 6409 aerofoil. Experimentally added Gourney flap and holes in side plates for simulation purposes.

Chassis - advanced surface modeling based on blueprints of BMW M3 E46 2004. Mirrors can't be added due to lack of proper Add-on in student edition of Solidworks.
